#4a Python program to extract all the numbers from a file and compute their sum using regular expressions:


import re

# Function to extract numbers and compute their sum from a file
def extract_numbers_and_sum(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        text = file.read()

        # Use regular expression to find all numbers in the text
        numbers = re.findall(r'\d+', text)

        # Convert the numbers from strings to integers and compute their sum
        numbers = [int(num) for num in numbers]
        total_sum = sum(numbers)

        return total_sum

# Replace 'file.txt' with the path to your file
file_path = 'file.txt'
result = extract_numbers_and_sum(file_path)
print(result)


#b. b. Write a program to extract specific patterns from a given sample sentence using regular expression-based chunking.


import re

# Sample sentence
sample_sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

# Define a regular expression pattern to extract specific patterns (e.g., words starting with 'q')
pattern = r'\bq\w*\b'

# Use regular expression to find all matching patterns in the sentence
matches = re.findall(pattern, sample_sentence, flags=re.IGNORECASE)

# Print the extracted patterns
print("Extracted Patterns:")
for match in matches:
    print(match)
