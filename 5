#5a  Write a Python program to create a list with n values. The list of integers with exactly two occurrences of nineteen and at least three occurrences of five.

def check_list(lst, n, m):
    count_19 = lst.count(19)
    count_5 = lst.count(5)
    
    return count_19 == n and count_5 >= m

# Sample inputs
input1 = [19, 19, 15, 5, 3, 5, 5, 2]
input2 = [19, 15, 15, 5, 3, 3, 5, 2]
input3 = [19, 19, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

# Check the conditions for each input and print the result
print(check_list(input1, 2, 3))  # Output: True
print(check_list(input2, 2, 3))  # Output: False
print(check_list(input3, 2, 3))  # Output: True


#b Write a program to demonstrate how to use the nltk library to process text and generate a part-of-speech tag for each word and draw the parsed result.


import nltk
text = "There is a man on the hill, and I watched him with mytelescope. "
tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
print(tokens)
tag = nltk.pos_tag(tokens)
print(tag)
grammar = "NP: {<DT>?<JJ>*<NN>}"
cp =nltk.RegexpParser(grammar)
result = cp.parse(tag)
print(result)
result.pretty_print()
