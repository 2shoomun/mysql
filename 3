#3a a. Write a program to plot the graph with the most frequently distributed word in the given text.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from collections import Counter

# Sample text
text = "This is a sample text for plotting the most frequent word. This is a simple example."

# Tokenize the text into words
words = text.split()

# Count the frequency of each word
word_count = Counter(words)

# Find the most frequent word
most_common_word, most_common_count = word_count.most_common(1)[0]

# Create a bar plot
plt.bar([most_common_word], [most_common_count])
plt.xlabel("Words")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.title(f"Most Frequent Word: '{most_common_word}'")
plt.show()


#b. Write a Python program to split a string of words separated by commas and spaces into two lists, words and separators.


import re

# Input string
input_string = "The colors in my studyroom are blue, green, and yellow."

# Split the string into words and separators
words = re.split(r'[\s,]+', input_string)
separators = re.findall(r'[\s,]+', input_string)

# Print the result as two lists
result = [words, separators]
print(result)
